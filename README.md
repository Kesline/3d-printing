# 3D-Printing  
**Machine Learning-Driven Optimization of PLA 3D Printing Parameters**

This repository contains the research project conducted by **Kesline Jean Baptiste** and **Jorwin Reyes** as part of the 2024 **IDS Student Fellowship Program**, funded by the **Sloan Foundation**. The project was presented at the **Massachusetts Undergraduate Research Conference (MassURC)** at UMass Amherst.

---

## 📌 Overview

The goal of this project was to optimize PLA 3D printing parameters using machine learning techniques. Starting with minimal prior experience in 3D printing and machine learning, we developed a system to recommend optimal print settings to enhance strength, finish, and efficiency.

---

## 🧠 Project Highlights

- **Data Collection**: Utilized a Prusa MK4 printer to gather real-world data.
- **Machine Learning**: Trained models to predict optimal printing parameters.
- **Collaboration**: Worked under the guidance of Prof. Kenneth Fletcher (faculty mentor) and Navkar J. (graduate mentor).

## 📊 Technologies & Tools

- **Python**  
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **scikit-learn**  
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (for neural networks)  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** (for data visualization)  
- **Prusa MK4** 3D printer  
- **CSV-based dataset** collected from experimental prints
